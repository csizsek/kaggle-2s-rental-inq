       "100021    Welcome to this 1 bedroom apartment which features flourishing natural lighting, hardwood floors, and exposed brick. There's a decorative fireplace in the common area which gives the unit a gorgeous house look. The kitchen has a serving window which faces the living room. Come check the place out and maybe you'll find your new home!<br /><br />Transportation: 4, 5, 6 trains. M15, M15 SBS, M79, M101, M102, and M103 buses. In the Area: This Upper East Side area is flowing with different restaurants which make this apartment perfect for foodies. Restaurants such as Luke's Lobster, Blockheads, Brother Jimmy's, and Sushi of Gari are only within a 5 block radius. Recreation venues such as Soulcycle, Bikram Yoga NYC, and Comic strip live are all within a short distance for you to try out.<br /><br />I pride my work in getting things done with integrity and diligence. Always having a knack for helping people in need I realize what is a better way to do it than helping find someone a new home? I know the whole moving experience (especially in the city) is not everyone's cup of tea (if anyone's) and it could bare a heavy burden on ones life. I am here to help relieve that burden and deliver a pleasurable search. Call/Text/Email before it's gone!<br /><br /><br /><br />-------------Listing courtesy of Miron Properties.
